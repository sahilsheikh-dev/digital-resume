            <p class="details">
                In this project, I spearheaded the design and execution of a serverless web application,
                strategically leveraging key AWS services to create a seamless and scalable solution. The primary goal
                was to engineer a responsive and interactive static website with dynamic visitor tracking capabilities,
                enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. The project showcases my proficiency in cloud technologies,
                full-stack development, and infrastructure as code.
