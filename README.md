# Hey 👋, This is Sahil

Bangalore based Software Developer Engineer who creates well-designed websites and applications. A tech nerd, and have used his programming powers mainly for good. Like many of his generation, he was drawn to coding originally as an angsty teen trying to make his MySpace page look cool-but not too cool.
<br /><br />
Since those days have been pretty busy both in-house and as a freelancer, and with his YouTube channel where teaches people how to develop. Have a variety of experience such as developing custom website themes and templates, frontend development in React, backend/RestAPIs/micro-services development in Java/Spring Boot, and speaks fluent HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Spring Boot.
<br /><br />
Loves to tackle a challenge head-on by analyzing it and coming up with a plan to solve the needs of his clients that makes sense for their big-picture goals. Most recently, developed and deployed a ReactJs and Spring Boot application on AWS, and working as a Software Engineer at Betsol (India).
